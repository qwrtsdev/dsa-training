# Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository is a collection of my _personal notes_ on **Data Structures & Algorithms**.

It contains markdown pages, code snippets, worked problems, and small experiments gathered from lectures, books, online courses, and other resources — rewritten in my own words to help me understand and remember.

This repository is publicly distributed for educational purposes. (made for juniors who sucks at DSA like me)

**Note** : some of them might unfinished and something probably wrong. feel free to discuss and send me a PR
