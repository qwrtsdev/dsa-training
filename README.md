# Data Structures & Algorithms — Personal Notes

This repository is a collection of my personal notes on Data Structures & Algorithms.

It contains markdown pages, code snippets, worked problems, and small experiments gathered from lectures, books, online courses, and other resources — rewritten in my own words to help me understand and remember.

This repository is publicly distributed for educational purposes. (made for juniors who sucks at DSA like me)

note: something probably wrong. feel free to discuss and send me a PR
